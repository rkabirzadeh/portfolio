         As a child I saw graphitti around town and I was intriged on how it was created and why someone would paint on trains, public buildings, etc. Every time I saw a train I would watch to see if there was graphiti on it. As I got a little older I got into 80's hip-hop and watched all the Breakin movies that had all the graphiti and music that I was into. Time went by and I never tried to create any art at all but I was reexposed to it at my friends tattoo shop. Next store to the tattoo shop was a graphiti store called The Montanna Store. It was filled with all the paint, markers and graphiti supplies anyone could ever want. I was exposed to alot of well know artist and got to see them paint often. Once a year they had an event called "Clogged Caps" where artists from around the world would come and paint designated walls around the shop and city. There were Dj's and thousands of spectators all around. I never thought I could do what these amazing artist were doing but I never got it out of my head. A couple years later I watched "Exit Through the Gift Shop" about street artist and one mans obsession trying to find the famous street artist "Banksy" I never intended to be good at graphiti or stencil art but I wanted to try to make stuff for my own enjoyment of trying to create. I started watching videos and reading about stencil art on line and decided to buy paint and give it a go.
